## About SMARTGIZI

**SMARTGIZI**  is an Android-based product Capstone, currently being developed by a team of 6 developers from Team SIB Capstone C23-PS217 in the **Bangkit Academy 2023 Program**. the team consists of 2 machine learning specialists, 2 cloud computing engineers, and 2 mobile development experts. SMARTGIZI utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance its functionality and provide innovative solutions in the field of healthcare.

## Background

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stunting is a condition that occurs during child growth and is characterized by nutritional deficiencies and an unsupportive environment (Schefflera, 2020). Based on the Research Study on Nutritional Status in Indonesia 2021, the prevalence of stunting has decreased from 27.7% in 2019. However, the National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020-2024 sets a target prevalence of 14% for stunting (Presidential Decree, 2020). Sari and Sartika (2021) show that parents' heights and parents' ages are related to the condition of child stunting at birth and the results of this study are supported by Young et al. (2018) who stated that birth outcomes are influenced by the nutritional status of preconception mothers (height, weight, and body mass-index). Mothers with short stature and teenage pregnancies are at risk of giving birth to low birth weight (LBW) babies, which contribute to around 20% of stunting cases (Ministry of Health, 2018). 

Therefore, our team is trying to help overcome this problem by building an Android-based application
can help predict the likelihood of a pregnant woman giving birth to a baby in a stunted condition based on the parameters of the mother's age, height and weight. In addition, the application is equipped with a healthy food recommendation feature according to the specified category. This application is expected to help pregnant women to get information on the condition of their fetus and determine the food consumed during pregnancy. Thus, the application can provide comprehensive support for pregnant women in maintaining optimal health and development for their fetus.

## Goal & Aim

Based on the background described above, the goal and aim of this project are:
- This application has the primary objective of providing valuable information to pregnant mothers regarding the possibility of giving birth to a baby with stunting condition. The information is derived from parameters such as the mother's age, height, and weight.
- This application can also recommend food menus that help pregnant women choose foods that suit their needs.
- Apart from its informative aspect, the SMARTGIZI app enhances the user experience by offering a wide range of resources. It includes a collection of articles focused on stunting prevention and the importance of maintaining a healthy diet during pregnancy.

## Features
- Nutrition : The nutritional features consist of two main features, namely **predictions** and **recommendations**. Users need to fill in data such as age, height and weight, after which they can see a prediction whether the baby has the potential to experience stunting or not. In addition, users can also see a list of food recommendations based on the category they choose.
- Article : This feature presents a list of articles related to the topic of stunting and pregnancy nutrition. Users can read all of these articles in full by clicking on them and viewing trusted article sources. These articles aim to provide in-depth and detailed information about stunting and pregnancy nutrition, so that users can gain better knowledge in this regard.
- Profile : The profile page consists of two main buttons, namely "Help" and "About". The "Help" button directs the user to information provided by the App Developer regarding available help and support. This gives users easy access to find help if they encounter a problem or have questions related to the application. Meanwhile, the "About" button directs the user to the app's description narration explaining the purpose, function. This helps users understand the app better and provides context on the background and vision of the app.
